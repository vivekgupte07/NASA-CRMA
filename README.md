# NASA Challenge : Common Restraint And Mobility Aid Systems for Multi-Gravity Environments

## [The Challenge](https://grabcad.com/challenges/nasa-challenge-a-common-restraint-and-mobility-aid-system-for-multiple-gravity-environments):
- Develop a common solution: a single system that will restrain crew members in microgravity, while being unobtrusive in gravity; that will enable astronauts to translate between decks on the Moon or Mars, but not be a passageway obstruction in microgravity. -
- The same system must be effective in any gravity field: 0g, 1/6g, 3/8g, and 1g with no reconfiguration. 
-  Properly designed and placed, restraints and mobility aids enable the crew to live and work effectively in space, on the Moon, and on Mars.
- Improper design or placement can reduce work efficiency, cause crew injury, result in equipment damage, or even lead to loss of life.

## The Solution:

### Restraint Chair and Folding Ladder
  _"This is a very well thought out system. The simplicity and adjustability
of it is very innovative. Restraint seat that can work in all gravity and a 
folding ladder system that can be reconfigured to a closed hatch. Very 
nice description in the document. I appreciate that you addressed
different aspects of the challenge, postural support and translation
between decks. The rotating rungs on the folding ladder are a good
innovation - will need to ensure they are geared such that they cannot
open when the ladder is in the closed position. The open hatch
position is very interesting, but not sure if it will ever be needed.
Your report is clear and well written. Good job."_
